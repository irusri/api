# API for PlantGenIE

Here we will discuss main API end points that we used in PlantGenIE. There are some important input parameters that we need to feed into the API.

#### User ID:

This is an important parameter to uniquely identify user and their previous actions. For example: GeneList and Experiment List. Current version of API uses random cookie ID as user ID. Keep in mind User ID is domain dependent which means we have to rely on the domain name when we use this type of User ID.
